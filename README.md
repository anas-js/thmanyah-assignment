## Project Overview
This project, **Thmanyah Assignment**, is designed to demonstrate my skills in Front End.

[Watch Video](https://github.com/anas-js/thmanyah-assignment/raw/refs/heads/main/preview.mp4)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* You must have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
* You need to have a running **MongoDB** instance. The backend is configured to connect to: `mongodb://localhost/thmanyah`.

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
2.  **Navigate into the project's root directory.**
3.  Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
    * **Backend Installation:**
        ```bash
        cd back-end
        npm install
        ```
    * **Frontend Installation:**
        ```bash
        cd ../front-end
        npm install
        ```

### ▶Running the Development Server

1.  **Start the Backend Server (API):**
    * Navigate to the `back-end` directory and run the start command. This server will run on **port 4000**.
        ```bash
        cd back-end
        npm run start
        ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Server (Next.js App):**
    * Navigate to the `front-end` directory and run the development command. This application will run on **port 3000**.
        ```bash
        cd ../front-end
        npm run dev
        ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
